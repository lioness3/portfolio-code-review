        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>Hello, my name is Joann Carter. I prefer to go by Jo or Jojo. I am an only child and my parents have always encouraged me to be <span style= "color:red"> kind, honest and hardworking.</span>I have had a difficult time figuring out what I want to do with the rest of my life. I consider myself an adventurous person because I thrive on being <span>spontaneous</span>. For example, I recently moved to the West Coast.</p>
        <p>Besides, traveling and random summer adventures, I have lived in Southern NH my entire life. Being spontataneous has its advantages because of the many opportunities to acquire new experiences. I have also tried many different careers. Such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Security Sales Manager</li>
          <li>Personal Shopper</li>
          <li>Automotive Repair Estimator</li>
          <li>Mixologist</li>
          <li><span style="background-color:yellow">Manicurist</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>As you can see, I have tried a wide variety of jobs. My most long lived career was as a manicurist at a fancy salon in NH. I was there for 9 years. It was difficult trying to prove my income with commission based jobs and, after a year of house hunting, I decided to find a studio apartemnt to rent until the housing market crashed. </p>
        <p class="impact">On memorial day of 2019, my cousin from the West Coast came to visit. Hearing my frustration, he suggested a coding bootcamp for a fast track career to stabilitize my income. Even though he was pretty convincing, I declined because I was signing a leasing for a studio the very next day. Turns out the landlord chose a tenant with no pets so I took that as a sign to go live near my cousin and attend Epicodus.</p>

        <h3>The Adventure to the West Coast</h3>
        <p>I left NH <strong>with my <em>cat</em></strong> on Thursday October 3rd 2019 and I arrived in Vancouver, WA on Saturday October 12th 2019.</p>
        <p>These are the stops I made along the way:</p>

        <h3>Arriving in Washington</h3>
        <p class="code">I made it to Vancouver with little time to spare. Unpacking and preparing for class was a challenge. This kaos gave me no time to be nervous for my first day. Turns out, I really enjoy coding! I am pleased with my progress since my <a href="https://github.com/lioness3/animal-shelter"><em>first</em></a> few assignments. </p>
