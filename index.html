    <h1>The Adventure from Coast to Coast</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Joann Carter but, to be honest, I hate my first name so i prefer to go by Jo or Jojo. Either is fine by me. I consider myself an Adventurer because i am pretty spontaneous. I recently moved to the West Coast. Its a peretty good story.I am an only child.My parents have always encouraged me to be kind, honest and hardwoekinh. I have hgad a difficukt time finding what I want to be when i grow up. </p>
    <p>Besides, traveling and random summer adventures, I lioved on the East COast my entire life. I have tried many different careers such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Security Sales Manager</li>
      <li>Personal Shopper</li>
      <li>Automotive Repair Estimator</li>
      <li>Mixologist</li>
      <li>Mancurist</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>AS you can see, I have tried a wide variety of jobs. NMy most long lived career was a manicurist at a fancy salon in NH. I was there for 9 years.I loved my job but i knew i couldnt do it firever and thats when i tried bartending. I did both jobs for a while while I was house hunting. It was difficult trying to prove my income with commission based jobs. Eventually, i decided to find a studio apartemnt to rent untill the housing market crashed. </p>
   <p>On memorial day of 2019 my cousin from the west coast came to see me</p>
