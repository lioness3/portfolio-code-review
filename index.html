      <h1>The Adventure from Coast to Coast</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Joann Carter. I prefer to go by Jo or Jojo. Either is fine by me. I consider myself an Adventurer because i am pretty spontaneous. For example, I recently moved to the West Coast. Its a peretty good story. I am an only child.My parents have always encouraged me to be kind, honest and hardworking. I have hgad a difficukt time finding what I want to be when i grow up. </p>
      <p>Besides, traveling and random summer adventures, I lived in southern NH my entire life. Being spontataneous has its advantages because you aquire many life experiances by trying many things. I have tried many different careers such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Security Sales Manager</li>
        <li>Personal Shopper</li>
        <li>Automotive Repair Estimator</li>
        <li>Mixologist</li>
        <li>Mancurist</li>
      </ul>
       </p>
       <p>As you can see, I have tried a wide variety of jobs. My most long lived career was a manicurist at a fancy salon in NH. I was there for 9 years. It was difficult trying to prove my income with commission based jobs. After a year of house hunting, i decided to find a studio apartemnt to rent untill the housing market crashed. </p>
       <p class="impact">On memorial day of 2019 my cousin from the west coast came to visit. Hearing my frustration, he suggested a coding bootcamp for a fast track career to stabilitize my income. Even though he was pretty convincing, I declined because I was signing a leasing for a studio the very next day.Turns out the landlord chose a tenant with no pets so i took that as a sign to go live near my cousin and attend Epicodus.</p>

        <h3>Arriving in Washington</h3>
        <p class="code">I made it to Vancouver with little time to spare. Unpacking and preparing for class was a challenge. This kaos gave me no time to be nervous for my first day. Turns out, I really enjoy coding! I am pleased with my progress since my <a href="https://github.com/lioness3/animal-shelter">first</a>few assignments. </p>
