      <h1>The Adventure from Coast to Coast</h1>
      <h5>About Me</h5>
      <p>Hello, my name is Joann Carter. I prefer to go by Jo or Jojo. I consider myself an adventurous person because I thrive on being <span>spontaneous</span>. For example, I recently moved to the West Coast.</p>
      <p>Besides traveling and random summer adventures, I lived in Southern NH my entire life. Being spontataneous has its advantages because you aquire many life experiances by trying new things and learning others perspectives on life. I have tried a wide variety of career paths such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security Sales Manager</li>
        <li>Personal Shopper</li>
        <li>Automotive Repair Estimator</li>
        <li>Mixologist</li>
        <li><span style="background-color:deepskyblue; color:white">Mancurist</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p>I was a manicurist for most of my working career. I worked at a salon in NH for 9 years.  It was a challenge trying to prove my income with commission based jobs. After a year of house hunting, I decided to find a studio apartemnt to rent until the housing market crashed. </p>
      <p class="impact">On memorial day of 2019, my cousin from the West Coast came to visit. Hearing my frustration, he suggested a coding bootcamp as a fast track career to stabilitize my income. Even though he was pretty convincing, I declined due to the lease I would be signing the very next day.Turns out, the landlord chose a another tenant without pets. I took the rejection as a sign to go live near my cousin and attend a coding bootcap, Epicodus.</p>

            <p>I left NH <strong>with my <em>cat</em></strong> on Thursday, October 3rd , 2019 and I arrived in Vancouver, WA on Saturday, October 12th, 2019.
            These are the stops I made along the way:

        <h3>Arriving in Washington</h3>
        <p class="code">I made it to Vancouver with little time to spare. Unpacking and preparing for class was a challenge. This kaos gave me no time to be nervous for my first day. Turns out, I really enjoy coding! I am pleased with my progress since my <a href="https://github.com/lioness3/animal-shelter"><em>first</em></a> few assignments.
